In project 5, I illustrate the design thought of my own CDN and do the bonus code

==========================================
Directory Layout
==========================================

project5 is the root directory
./report.pdf                   : final report
./paper                        : original latex files for final report
./nearest_replica              : shell script to launch bonus program
./nearest_replica.py           : python script to get nearest replica server

launch program:
./nearest_replica <ip>


===========================================
Challenges:
===========================================

1. It takes me a lot of time to read papers about CDN and cache replacement strategy, to select best algorithm for my project.
