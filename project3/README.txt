The final paper is report.pdf in project3

========================================================
Directory Layout

project3 is the project root directory
/report.pdf                    : project final report
/paper                         : all files for latex report
/experiment1                   : all files for experiment1
/experiment2                   : all files for experiment2
/experiment3                   : all files for experiment3

for each experiment
/experiment1/data              : NS-2 raw trace logs folder
/experiment1/plots             : The analysis result of raw trace logs and gnuplot scripts 
/experiment1/analyze_logs.py   : python script to analyze raw trace logs
/experiment1/experiment_1.tcl  : NS-2 script to perform a single test
/experiment1/run_test.sh       : automatically run all the tests in experiment

You should run run_test.sh first and then run analyze_logs.py

=========================================================

Challenges:
I need learn to serval new tools, such as NS-2, gnuplot and latex to do this project well. How to set up the network topology in NS-2 and retrieve information from raw trace logs are the biggest challenges. Moreover, I spent a lot of time on how explain the result in report and using latex to perform my idea.
