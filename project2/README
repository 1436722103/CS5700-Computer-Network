In this project, I use socket to send GET and POST to server, and use Breath first search to crawl the website. Then use regular expression and xpath to analyze the response.

The biggest challenge is how to use sessionid and crvftoken as token in cookie to login server, I spend two days on it. Then the rest is how to implement BFS and optimize the algorithm to crawl the whole website.

Yunfan Tian (me) do all the work in two days. My teammate Hao Li learn Math before and don't have too much coding experice, So I ask him to read some articles and codes and practice. 

scenario 1: Bad input
Program will print 'Invalid username or password' to screen and exit.

scenario 2: right username and password
Program will print 5 lines of secret flags to screen, and output flags to file. When the number of secret flags is 5, program will exit.
